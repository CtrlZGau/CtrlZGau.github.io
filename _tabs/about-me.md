<span style="font-size:1.5em;">Hey there! I am Gautham Balachandran.</span>

I am an undergraduate student at **Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani**, pursuing a **Bachelor of Engineering in Chemical Engineering** (CGPA: 8.67) with a deep interest in **robotics, machine learning, and autonomous systems**.

I currently work as a **Research Intern** at **HiRo Lab, CPS Department, IISc Bangalore**, where I focus on **bimanual imitation learning**, **visual servoing in MuJoCo**, and **dynamic throwing pipelines in Drake**. I also explore optimization-based control and heuristic algorithms for **Bin Packing** and preference-aware planning.

At **Inspire Lab, BITS Pilani**, I work as a **Research Student** on **multi-robot coordination strategies** for collaborative navigation and task execution in dynamic environments, using graph-based scene representations and segmentation-based mapping to support robust decision-making.

Previously, I served as **Software Subsystem Lead** at **Criss Robotics**, where I helped the team secure **3rd place** in the **European Rover Challenge (ERC) 2025 – Remote Category** by leading development of autonomous navigation, 3D terrain mapping, and multi-sensor fusion pipelines in ROS and Unity-based simulations.

My research interests span **imitation learning, deep reinforcement learning, 3D perception, and human-in-the-loop planning**. I enjoy working across the stack—from low-level robotics infrastructure and perception to high-level decision-making and user-aligned autonomy.

You can find a detailed summary of my background on the **CV** tab in the sidebar.
