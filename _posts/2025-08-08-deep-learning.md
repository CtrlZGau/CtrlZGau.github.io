# Deep Learning

These are my personal notes while studying core deep learning concepts and their applications to robotics and autonomous systems.
The series is divided into four broad parts:
1. [Perceptrons](/posts/deep-learning-perceptrons/)
2. [CNNs, RNNs, and Language Models](/posts/deep-learning-cnn-rnn-lang/)
3. [Attention and Transformers](/posts/deep-learning-advanced/) - why attention is all we need
4. Generative Modeling
